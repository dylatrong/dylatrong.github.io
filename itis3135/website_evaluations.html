        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="http://arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren.net</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                Arngren is a Norwegian gadget retailer website that is infamous in the web design community. 
                It functions as a digital catalog but lacks almost all modern structural elements, looking more like a collage than a store.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site fails significantly here; blue text links are placed over busy, multi-colored images, making them nearly impossible to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is no consistent font hierarchy or color palette. Every element competes for attention with different sizes and colors.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The layout ignores grid systems entirely. Images and text blocks are scattered randomly rather than aligned to a common edge.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> There is zero whitespace or grouping. Toys, car parts, and electronics are mashed together, making it difficult to tell which price tag belongs to which item.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Assessment:</strong> This site is a textbook example of poor design because it ignores alignment and proximity, resulting in a cognitive overload for the user.

            <h3><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a></h3>
            
            <p>
                Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform known for setting high standards in modern web UI/UX, focusing on developer experience and clarity.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses sharp contrast between the dark text and clean white background (or dark mode equivalents), as well as vibrant accent colors for call-to-action buttons.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> They utilize a consistent "glassmorphism" blur effect, specific font weights, and a unified color palette across all sections.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Every element, from the navigation bar to the feature lists, snaps to a strict grid, guiding the user's eye naturally down the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Generous padding and margins separate different product features, while related headlines and subtext are grouped tightly together.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Assessment:</strong> Stripe effectively uses proximity and alignment to create a layout that feels organized, professional, and easy to navigate.
